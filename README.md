# Poker

Elixir source for solving Euler problem no. 54.

## Build

Use `mix compile` to compile source. Use `mix test` to run tests.

Use `iex -S mix` to start an interactive shell for the project. Use `recompile()` to compile sources again from the shell. Modules under `/lib` are available by name, i.e. `Card.parseCard("2H")`.
